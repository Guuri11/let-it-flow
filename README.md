# Let it flow üß†‚ú®
Let it flow is a friendly note app with neumorphic UI concept and animations to improve the UX.
The inspiration was that I didn't find a note app that could create notes ASAP, so I decided to make it by my own.
I wanted to get many ways to interact with the notes with the basic CRUD so I could:
- CRUD functions with voice commanders üó£Ô∏è
- CRUD functions with buttons
- Play with animations so the user can do some funcionalities with it.

#### So is that all? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have to say yes, that's all. The first idea was to build a workspace app as you can see in old commits. But I rather build different apps with other libraries and keep trying new & cool things.
Now I have a solid note app with a cool UI/UX that brings me all what I needed to create my own notes.

Any new feature will be focus on improving the app as a note app.
