# Let it flow 🧠✨
Let it flow is a friendly note app with neumorphic UI concept and animations to improve the UX.
The inspiration was that I didn't find a note app that could create notes ASAP, so I decided to make it by my own.
I wanted to get many ways to interact with the notes with the basic CRUD so I could:
- CRUD functions with voice commanders 🗣️
- CRUD functions with buttons
- Play with animations so the user can do some funcionalities with it.

#### So is that all? 🤷‍♂️
NO! The final idea is to convert Let it flow into a workspace app 💪💻 including kanban, reminders ...

All with a smooth and fast experience, thats the most important thing.

#### What is it built with
- React JS 
- Firebase
- PWA
- React Native (to do)
